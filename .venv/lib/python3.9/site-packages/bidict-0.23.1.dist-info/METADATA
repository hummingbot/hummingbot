Features
--------

- Mature: Depended on by
  Google, Venmo, CERN, Baidu, Tencent,
  and teams across the world since 2009

- Familiar, Pythonic APIs
  that are carefully designed for
  safety, simplicity, flexibility, and ergonomics

- Lightweight, with no runtime dependencies
  outside Python's standard library

- Implemented in
  concise, well-factored, fully type-hinted Python code
  that is optimized for running efficiently
  as well as for long-term maintenance and stability
  (as well as `joy <#learning-from-bidict>`__)

- Extensively `documented <https://bidict.readthedocs.io>`__

- 100% test coverage
  running continuously across all supported Python versions
  (including property-based tests and benchmarks)


Installation
------------

``pip install bidict``


Quick Start
-----------

.. code:: python

   >>> from bidict import bidict
   >>> element_by_symbol = bidict({'H': 'hydrogen'})
   >>> element_by_symbol['H']
   'hydrogen'
   >>> element_by_symbol.inverse['hydrogen']
   'H'

Changelog
---------

Release Notifications
---------------------

.. duplicated in CHANGELOG.rst:
   (Would use `.. include::` but GitHub's renderer doesn't support it.)

Watch `bidict releases on GitHub <https://github.com/jab/bidict/releases>`__
to be notified when new versions of bidict are published.
Click the "Watch" dropdown, choose "Custom", and then choose "Releases".


Learning from bidict
--------------------

One of the best things about bidict
is that it touches a surprising number of
interesting Python corners,
especially given its small size and scope.

Check out :doc:`learning-from-bidict` [#fn-learning]_
if you're interested in learning more.


Contributing
------------

I have been bidict's sole maintainer
and `active contributor <https://github.com/jab/bidict/graphs/contributors>`__
since I started the project ~15 years ago.

Your help would be most welcome!
See the :doc:`contributors-guide` [#fn-contributing]_
for more information.


Sponsoring
----------

.. duplicated in CONTRIBUTING.rst
   (Would use `.. include::` but GitHub's renderer doesn't support it.)

.. image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-sponsor-ff69b4
  :target: https://github.com/sponsors/jab
  :alt: Sponsor through GitHub

Bidict is the product of thousands of hours of my unpaid work
over the 15+ years that I've been the sole maintainer.

If bidict has helped you or your company accomplish your work,
please sponsor my work through one of the following,
and/or ask your company to do the same:

- `GitHub <https://github.com/sponsors/jab>`__
- `PayPal <https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_xclick&business=jabronson%40gmail%2ecom&lc=US&item_name=Sponsor%20bidict>`__
- `Tidelift <https://tidelift.com>`__
- `thanks.dev <https://thanks.dev>`__
- `Gumroad <https://gumroad.com/l/bidict>`__
- `a support engagement with my LLC <#enterprise-support>`__

If you're not sure which to use, GitHub is an easy option,
especially if you already have a GitHub account.
Just choose a monthly or one-time amount, and GitHub handles everything else.
Your bidict sponsorship on GitHub will automatically go
on the same regular bill as any other GitHub charges you pay for.
PayPal is another easy option for one-time contributions.
