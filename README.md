Hummingbot is an open-source framework that helps you design and deploy automated trading strategies, or **bots**, that can run on many centralized or decentralized exchanges. Over the past year, Hummingbot users have generated over $34 billion in trading volume across 140+ unique trading venues.

The Hummingbot codebase is free and publicly available under the Apache 2.0 open-source license. Our mission is to **democratize high-frequency trading** by creating a global community of algorithmic traders and developers that share knowledge and contribute to the codebase.

## Exchange Connectors

Hummingbot connectors standardize REST and WebSocket API interfaces to different types of exchanges, enabling you to build sophisticated trading strategies that can be deployed across many exchanges with minimal changes.  We classify exchanges into the following categories:

* **CEX**: Centralized exchanges that take custody of your funds. Use API keys to connect with Hummingbot.
* **DEX**: Decentralized, non-custodial exchanges that operate on a blockchain. Use wallet keys to connect with Hummingbot.

In addition, connectors differ based on the type of market supported:

 * **CLOB Spot**: Connectors to spot markets on central limit order book (CLOB) exchanges
 * **CLOB Perp**: Connectors to perpetual futures markets on CLOB exchanges
 * **AMM**: Connectors to spot markets on Automatic Market Maker (AMM) decentralized exchanges
