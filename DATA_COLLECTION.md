# Important Disclosure re: Hummingbot Data Collection
 
Hummingbot (“Hummingbot”) is open-source software developed and maintained by Hummingbot Foundation ("The Foundation, “we”, or “us”) and available at https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot.

The Foundation collects certain usage information from users that have configured Hummingbot to allow for the sharing of this data.

## Purpose of data collection

### Software improvement

Data collected by the Foundation is used to help improve Hummingbot for all users. It is important that our team understands the usage patterns and detects bugs as soon as possible, so we can best decide how to design future features and prioritize current work.

### Support

Users who provide data allow us to more easily diagnose problems, troubleshoot, and resolve any issues encountered when running Hummingbot.

## Types of data collected

Hummingbot aggregates and collects total traded volume per exchange denominated in USDT. The data collected is subsequently reported to the Foundation's backend services.

All data collected will be used exclusively by the Foundation team for analytical and marketing purposes only. The data will be neither accessible nor sold to any third party.

## Sensitive data

Hummingbot will never collect and/or report sensitive information, such as private keys, API keys, or passwords.

## How do I opt-in to or opt-out of data sharing?

See https://docs.hummingbot.org/reporting for information on configuring this functionality.

## How this data is used

When enabled by a user, data is reported by Hummingbot to the Foundation. The Foundation uses its own, third-party systems, as well as commercial software (such as Datadog Inc.) to collect and process data.
