## What is it?
Liquidity mining is a community-based, data-driven approach to market making, in which a token issuer or exchange can reward a pool of miners to provide liquidity for a specified token.

Liquidity mining sets forth an analytical framework for determining market maker compensation based on (1) time (order book consistency), (2) order spreads, and (3) order sizes, in order to create a fair model for compensation that aligns a miner's risk with rewards.

## Token Issuers


### iExec

[iExec (RLC)](https://iex.ec/) claims to have developed the first decentralized marketplace for cloud computing resources. Blockchain technology is used to organize a market network where users can monetize their computing power, applications, and datasets. By providing on-demand access to cloud computing resources, iExec is reportedly able to support compute-intensive applications in fields such as AI, big data, healthcare, rendering, or FinTech. iExec's RLC token has been listed on Binance, Bittrex, etc.

### Mainframe

The [Mainframe (MFT)](https://mainframe.com/) Lending Protocol allows anyone to borrow against their crypto. Mainframe uses a bond-like instrument, representing an on-chain obligation that settles on a specific future date. Buying and selling the tokenized debt enables fixed-rate lending and borrowing — something much needed in decentralized finance today.

### Solana

[Solana (SOL)](https://solana.com) is a high-performance blockchain based out of San Francisco. The project was founded with the mission to support all high-growth and high-frequency blockchain applications, and to democratize the world’s financial systems. As of today, Solana can support up to 50,000 transactions per second, with 400ms block times and transaction fees estimated to be $0.00001 each, which will continue to scale further as its network architecture was designed from the ground up to leverage improvements in hardware and bandwidth.

### Zcoin

[ZCoin (XZC)](https://zcoin.io/) is an open-source privacy-focused cryptocurrency token that launched in Sep 2016. Zcoin originally pioneered the use of Zerocoin to enable privacy but has since transitioned to a scheme called Sigma which is based on a paper by Jens Groth and Markulf Kohlweiss that reportedly allows greater scalability and removes the need for trusted setup in Zerocoin. With Zcoin’s Sigma feature, only the sender and receiver would be able to ascertain the exchange of funds in a given transaction, as no transaction histories are linked to the actual coins. Zcoin is also the creator of the Lelantus privacy protocol which improves Sigma's privacy and functionality. Its ZC token has been listed on Binance, Huobi Global, Bittrex, etc.

### Zilliqa

[Zilliqa (ZIL)](https://zilliqa.com/) is a base-layer blockchain protocol centered around the idea of 'Sharding' and designed to enhance the scalability of cryptocurrency networks such as Ethereum. According to its white paper, transactions speed could scale to approximately 1,000x that of Ethereum's network. Zilliqa’s high throughput means that developers can focus on fleshing out their ideas rather than worrying about network congestion.
