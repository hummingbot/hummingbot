## New Exchange Connector: ProBit

In this release, Hummingbot has added more exchanges and is planning to add a lot more exchanges this year! Hummingbot now supports [ProBit](https://www.probit.com/) connector. ProBit Exchange describes itself as a global coin-to-coin cryptocurrency exchange. ProBit Exchange only lists what it deems to be 'qualified and deserving' cryptocurrency projects. ProBit Exchange reportedly has an order matching speed of over 1.5 million orders per second and a customizable user interface. In addition, ProBit Exchange claims to provide users with the option of a hardware security key in addition to 2 Factor Authentication.

ProBit is compatible with [pure market making](https://docs.hummingbot.io/strategies/pure-market-making/), [cross-exchange market-making](/strategies/cross-exchange-market-making/), [arbitrage](/strategies/arbitrage/), [amm arbitrage](/strategies/amm-arb/), and [spot perpetual arbitrage](/strategies/spot-perpetual-arb/).

## New Protocol Connector: Perpetual Finance

In v0.37, Hummingbot has added a new protocol connector, [Perpetual Finance](https://perp.fi/).

Perpetual protocol is a decentralized protocol to trade perpetual contracts for every asset powered by a Virtual Automated Market Maker (vAMM). The project aims to create novel financial instruments by democratizing Futures and other crypto-asset derivatives.

## Introducing the new Spot Perpetual Arbitrage strategy (Beta)

In v0.37, we introduce the new Spot Perpetual Arbitrage strategy! This strategy lets you arbitrage between a spot and futures exchange. The differences between the prices on the spot and futures markets before the settlement date give a good sense of the direction in which both markets would go. Prices on both futures and spots will converge as the settlement date or time approaches.

This strategy aims to open a position in one direction and execute an order in the opposite direction on the spot. Learn more about the [Spot Perpetual Arbitrage](/strategies/spot-perpetual-arb/).

## Improvements to Liquidity Mining strategy

We added two new parameters [`max_spread`](/strategies/liquidity-mining/#max_spread) and [`max_order_age`](/strategies/liquidity-mining/#max_order_age) to Liquidity Mining strategy to give users a more functionality when using the strategy. Users now have the option to turn off `inventory_skew` and disable `target_base_pct`.

Tables are added to display the campaign, base, and quote balance in more detail. Balance distribution has also been improved on the user's selected `token`.
