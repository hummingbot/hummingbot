# Release Notes - Version 0.25.0

🚀 Welcome to `hummingbot` version 0.25.0! In this release, we continued working on the stability of Liquidity Mining backend, scaling/optimizing the infrastructure for quicker updates and incrased capacity. There are also major improvements in pure market making strategy including inventory skew, status outputs, hanging order mode, and filled order delays.


## 🚰 Updated dependencies to improve stability

In order to address memory leaks that cause the bot to crash, we upgraded Python to version 3.8 as well as `prompt-toolkit`, the client interface framework. These fixes should greatly improve bot stability and reduce crashes due to memory leaks.

In addition, we advise users to not `stop` and `start` the bot frequently before running it long-term. This appears to elevate memory usage and cause the bot to crash more frequently. We continue to monitor this issue.

!!! tip "Updating from source"
    Due to the updated Python version, users who install Hummingbot from source need to run `./uninstall` and `./clean` before updating.

## 💥 New `status` command
We made some changes to how bot `status` is displayed to make it more informative for users.

* Added **Hang** column to indicate if the active order is a hanging order
* Shows the current **Mid price**

## 📊 New Advanced Market Marketing section

Due to the extreme market volatility in the last 2 weeks, many users have reporting losing money due to market swings. In this release, we have made major improvements to advanced market making features. We believe that these features will enable users to configure their bots so that they respond better to market volatility.

See the new [Advanced Market Marketing](/strategies/advanced-mm) section to learn more about how these features work. We have described the main changes below.

### Inventory skew

We changed the inventory skew algorithm to a better behaved one to limit the user's trading exposure within a defined range. This prevents users from being over-exposed from the risks of a single side of the trade when the market keeps hitting limit orders on one side only.

More information can be found in our documentation for [Inventory Skew](/strategies/advanced-mm/inventory-skew) with sample scenarios.

### Hanging orders

Hanging orders are now tracked as active orders when sending the `status` command. These orders will get cancelled after sending the `stop` or `exit` command. Also, users can now specify through `cancel_hanging_order_pct` to cancel hanging orders when their spreads are above a certain value.

Read through [Hanging Orders](/strategies/advanced-mm/hanging-orders) in our documentation for more information.

### Safer defaults

In addition to these advanced features, we also changed the default values of the following parameters to make them safer for new users:

* `cancel_order_wait_time`: now **30** seconds (previously 60 seconds)
* `filled_order_replenish_wait_time`: now **60** seconds (previously 10 seconds)

## 🐞 Other bug fixes

* Fixed Hummingbot resetting to a command line screen when errors are shown: [#1519](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/issues/1519)


## ⚙️ Miscellaneous updates

* Hummingbot Miner now supports Ledger Nano X as as well as mobile wallets such as Metamask Mobile, Coinbase Wallet, and Trust Wallet.
* Minimum order amount validation now applies to `order_start_size` prompt in multiple order mode
* `start` command no longer cancels and replaces orders if the strategy is already running
