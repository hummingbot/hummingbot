# Release Notes - Version 0.5.0

🚀Welcome to `hummingbot` version 0.5.0! In this release, we focused on fixing bugs, building transaction costs into exchange connectors, and adding more documentation. Below are the most significant updates:

## 💸 Arbitrage strategy now incorporates exchange-specific transaction costs

As requested by many users, we have codified exchange-specific transaction costs such as trading fees and gas costs (for decentralized exchanges) into each exchange connector.

This allowed us to incorporate fee/gas logic into the [arbitrage](/strategies/arbitrage) strategy, so that users can set a `min_profitability` parameter that is **net of exchange transaction costs**. Please note that we will be testing this feature heavily this sprint, and that issues may arise as a result of this change.

We plan to add this to the [cross-exchange market making](/strategies/cross-exchange-market-making) strategy in the next release.

## 💻 Improved CLI commands

We added and improved a number of the commands in the Hummingbot command line interface:

![status command](/assets/img/status-command.png)

* `status`: we revamped the output of the `status` command to be more consistent across strategies and to provide more granular information
* `list configs`: this command now lists the value for each configuration parameter
* `config [parameter name]`: this command, which allows users to change bot parameters without exiting Hummingbot, now supports tab auto-complete, which makes changing parameters much easier
* `export_private_key`: this new command allows you to export a wallet created/imported in Hummingbot to other applications

## 📝 New docs for strategies, debug console, known issues, etc

New documentation in this release includes:

* [Strategies](/strategies): diagrams and explanations of Hummingbot's strategies
* [Debug console](/developers/debug): how to use the debug console to inspect your bot in real-time
* Known issues: list of currently outstanding issues and their resolution status
* [Windows installation](/installation/docker/windows): how to install Hummingbot on Windows
* [Exchange rates](https://docs.hummingbot.io/advanced/exchange-rates/): how to use the exchange rates utility class to resolve price differences between stablecoins
