## 📊 Pure market making configuration simplified

Pure market making now has a basic/advanced split that will only prompt during configuration of the basic parameters such as the exchange name, trading pair, bid/ask spreads, cancel order wait time, and order amount.

Users can configure the advanced features of this strategy by entering `Yes` when prompted, via `config <parameter>` command in Hummingbot, or by editing the strategy config file.

## 🔗 New KuCoin connector

Hummingbot now supports [KuCoin](https://www.kucoin.com/) exchange! Nicknamed the "People's Exchange"​, Kucoin is easy to use for novice investors and in-depth enough for crypto enthusiasts. It has one of the world’s most impressive trading pair selections, a wide range of alt coins with more than 300 trading pairs and are adding new ones regularly.

Read more about how to use KuCoin connector in the [User Manual](https://docs.hummingbot.io/connectors/kucoin/).


## 📜 Error log collection

Instead of using the old `hummingbot_logs.yml` templates for sending logs, we now added a prompt in Hummingbot that allows users to enable or disabled sending errors logs.

Read through [Logs and Logging](https://docs.hummingbot.io/advanced/logging/#error-log-collection) section of our Utilities page for more information.


## 🤓 Developer documentation

We created a guide that walks you through how to prepare your development environment and get started developing for Hummingbot using Linux, macOS and Windows.
