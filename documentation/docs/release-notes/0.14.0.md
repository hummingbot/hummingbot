🚀Welcome to `hummingbot` version 0.14.0! This release includes a new Huobi connector and improved developer documentation.

## 🔗 New Huobi Global connector

Hummingbot now support [Huobi Global](https://www.hbg.com)!  You can read more about how to use the Huobi Global connector in the [user manual](/connectors/huobi/).

⚠️ Please note that there are some known issues for this connector which we are working on:

* Developer documentation for discovery strategy.


## 🐞 Other bug fixes and miscellaneous updates

Thanks to everyone who reported bugs! **Note that we pay bug bounties to anyone who reports a bug that we end up fixing.**
