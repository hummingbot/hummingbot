# Release Notes - Version 0.20.0

🚀 Welcome to `hummingbot` version 0.20.0! In this release, we mainly addressed a number of bugs. Separately from the `hummingbot` client, the team has been hard at work on the Liquidity Mining infrastructure, with campaigns on target for a mid-February launch.

## 🤖 UI Update
* We have added a feature that allows you to encrypt and decrypt your exchange API keys. Please review `Step 3: Configure a market making bot` in our [Quickstart guide](https://docs.hummingbot.io/quickstart/configure/) for more details.

## 🌊⛏ Liquidity mining update

In mid February 2020, we plan to launch liquidity mining campaigns for our launch partners on 0x Mesh and Binance. There will be approximately US \$3,000-$8,000 per month in rewards for liquidity miners to earn in each campaign.

Also, we recently released a blog explaining how liquidity mining rewards are calculated on our new platform. For more information, read through our blog posts:
