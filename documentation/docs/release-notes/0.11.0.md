🚀Welcome to `hummingbot` version 0.11.0! In this release, we focused on making Hummingbot more accessible for developers and improving the bounty hunter experience. Please see below for what's new in this release.

## 📝 Introducing the Developer Manual

We have created a new section in our docs for developers who want to contribute to Hummingbot and extend its capabilities.

Initially, it's focused on helping users understand how Hummingbot strategies work, especially the pure market making strategy.

Over time, we will add more content to the other sections.

## 🤖 New strategy: `simple_trade`

We added a new strategy: [Simple Trade](https://docs.hummingbot.io/developers/tutorial/simple-trade/). 

This strategy gives users a starter template upon which to customize their own strategies.

## 📟 Bounty registration recovery

Liquidity Bounty participants can now use the `bounty --restore-id` command to recover their registration info.

If you accidentally deleted your Docker container and lost your `conf_liquidity_bounty.yml` file, you can now recover it and conttinue to earn rewards.

## 📊 CoinGecko data feed integration

Accessing live market prices and other data that may affect trading is an important aspect of running trading bots.

We have integrated the price feed from [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en), one of the most comprehensive public crypto data APIs available.
