# Release Notes - Version 0.32.0


## 🔗 New connector: Bitfinex

Hummingbot now supports [Bitfinex](https://www.bitfinex.com/) exchange! Bitfinex is a cryptocurrency exchange owned and operated by iFinex Inc., which is headquartered in Hong Kong and registered in the British Virgin Islands.

Bitfinex was founded in December 2012 as a peer-to-peer Bitcoin exchange, offering digital asset trading services to users around the world. Bitfinex initially started as a P2P margin lending platform for Bitcoin and later added support for more cryptocurrencies.

## 🎛 New pure market making feature: Order Override

Advanced users can now customize and specify how Hummingbot creates orders in terms of order levels, spread and size.

Since this feature is for advanced users, it is not configurable from the Hummingbot client. Follow the guide in our documentation how to use the [Order Override](/strategies/advanced-mm/order-override) feature.


## 📈 New price reference: Last Own Trade Price

We added `last_own_trade_price` to `price_type` in pure market making to allow users use their own last trade price as a price reference when creating orders.

More information in [External Pricing Source Configuration](/strategies/advanced-mm/price-source).


## 🛫 More parameters configurable on the fly

The following parameters can now be reconfigured even without stopping the strategy. Take note that changes will take effect on the next order refresh.

- `order_amount`
- `order_levels`
- `order_level_spread`
- `filled_order_delay`
- `inventory_skew_enabled`
- `inventory_target_base_pct`
- `inventory_range_multiplier`

!!! note
    Currently, `inventory_target_base_pct` can only be configured when running on centralized exchange connectors.


## 📊 New command: Ticker

This new command displays a specific market's ticker prices such as best bid, best ask, mid price and last trade price. By default, it runs the output 10 times with 1 second in between intervals.

Optional arguments for this command and sample usage can be found in our [documentation](/operation/commands/ticker).


## 💻 Developers Updates

### Connector Change Summary

In the ongoing effort to make the Hummingbot code base more developer friendly, we refactored several parts of the exchange connector code to make it easier to add additional exchanges in the future:

* A major update on [Task 4. Required Connector Configuration](/developers/connectors/task4.md), most of these tasks are now contained within the connector package, you no longer need to update various other files in the Hummingbot.
