## 🎚️ Reduce number of Ethereum node calls

Refactored block watchers and web3 wallet modules to materially reduce the number of interactions with the Ethereum node.

## 🤓 Developer usability

As part of our ongoing efforts to make the Hummingbot code base more understandable and easier to use for developers, 0.13.0 includes quite a bit of new explanations and documentation:

* Developer documentation for [cross exchange market making](/developers/strategies/cross-exchange-market-making/)
* Developer documentation for [adding exchange connectors](/developers/connectors/)
* Extensive comments in the strategy code files: [arbitrage](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/tree/master/hummingbot/strategy/arbitrage), [cross exchange market making](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/blob/master/hummingbot/strategy/cross_exchange_market_making), and discovery

## 💻 Autostart a strategy on launch with new CLI launch commands

Hummingbot now allows you to launch Hummingbot and automatically start a previously configured strategy without requiring `config` and `start` to be run in the Hummingbot client interface.  Users can now specify the strategy, config file, and wallet details (if required for DEX trading) when launching Hummingbot, allowing for the strategy to auto-start.

For more details, see here: [trading strategy autostart](https://docs.hummingbot.io/advanced/autostart/).

## Add use of API key for IDEX connector

On Friday August 23, IDEX released updates to its servers requiring authentication/use of API keys to access its APIs.  For more information, see IDEX API key.
