## New Spot Connector: NDAX

[NDAX](https://ndax.io/) (National Digital Asset Exchange) is a Canadian-based centralized exchange which is fully integrated into the Canadian banking system and designed for both individuals and institutions.

They are incorporated in the province of Alberta and registered as a Money Service Business (MSB), making them subject to the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act (PCMLTFA) and applicable regulatory framework of the Financial Transactions and Reports and Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC).

## New Global Config: Rate Limits Share Pct

We added a new global parameter that allows user to set a certain percentage of rate limit to each bot when running multiple instances of Hummingbot. This is useful when using a single exchange account across all instances.

To set this value, run `config rate_limits_share_pct` in the Hummingbot client.

## Developer Updates

- Removed mock web server usages from the tests in `/test/hummingbot/core/api_throttler/` which will be replaced in the future and causes the workflow checks in Github to fail occasionally
- Fixed and added unit tests to not consider AscendEX inflight orders as open order when in "Filled" status
- Added fields `filled_amount` (Decimal), `creation_timestamp` (int), `status` (int) to `LimitOrder` [#3622](https://github.com/coinalpha/hummingbot/issues/3622)
- Created a new multi-limit pool throttler class to handle rate limits where a call can increase multiple pools as described in [#3758](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/pull/3758)
- In subsequent releases, we will make changes and improve the multi-pool throttler as well as consolidate existing different version of throttler. More details in this story [#3766](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/issues/3766)
