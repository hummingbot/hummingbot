## New Market Making Strategy: Aroon Oscillator

In this release, we shipped out a new strategy into production which was the winning submission for our first Open DeFi hackathon.

The strategy attempts to take a well-known set of market indicators called Aroon Indicators that collect trade prices over a configurable set of periods of a given duration. They represent how recent the highest highs and the lowest lows are. And the Oscillator Indicator can strongly suggest a market trend.

More information in [Aroon Oscillator](/strategies/aroon-oscillator) documentation.


## New Strategy: Hedge

The winning submission for the recent dYdX hackathon bounty is also available starting this release. This strategy allows you to hedge a market making strategy by automatically opening short positions on dydx_perpetual or another `perp` exchange. Configs like hedge_ratio allow you to customize how much to hedge. Users are expected to run this strategy alongside another market making strategy.

More information in [Hedge](/strategies/hedge) documentation.


## Client UI Improvements

![New Hummingbot UI](/assets/img/hb_client_new_1.png)

- Adjusted default panel colors to create a division between the input pane and log pane
- Changed top panel colors including paper trade mode indicator
- Added a button in the upper-right corner or press `CTRL + T` to open and close the log pane
- Added global configuration parameters allowing users to specify and customize colors inside the client terminal (`top-pane`, `bottom-pane`, `output-pane`, `input-pane`, `logs-pane`, `terminal-primary`)
- Press `CTRL + R` to reset the style to use default colors


## Developer Updates

- Added HTTP `Referer` header into `_create_order` requests in `bybit_perpetual` connector
- Previously, we instruct users to install the required dependencies using `pip` when creating a Docker image on ARM. Since miniconda already supports ARM architecture, we updated the `Dockerfile` to create an image on ARM using miniconda and manage all dependencies
- Cleaned up unnecessary dependencies from the `conda` config files for Windows and Mac
- Removed legacy feature used to enforce a minimum order size in the Hummingbot client when creating or reconfiguring a strategy (`min_quote_order_amount`, `minimum_order_amount`, `default_min_quote`)
- Removed outdated connectors (`bamboo_relay`, `radar_relay`, `dolomite`, `eterbase`) and any reference to their code
- Cleaned up unused and legacy codes found in the codebase. More information in [#4420](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/issues/4420)
- Replaced `websockets` library with `aiohttp` in `MockWebSocketServer` component and the following connectors: `binance`, `binance_perpetual`, `kucoin`, `ascend_ex`, `gate_io`, `crypto_com`, `ndax`
- Updated all calls to `asyncio.ensure_future()` to `safe_ensure_future()` to ensure proper error logs from background tasks. More information in [#2516](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/issues/2516)
- Removed all Hummingsim dependencies no longer needed. Replaced certain Hummingsim classes with Hummingbot classes. More information in [#4260](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/issues/4260)
- Unit tests added for `bitmart` connector
- Unit tests added for [`ConfigVar`](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/blob/master/hummingbot/client/config/config_var.py) class
- Deprecated `MockEventListener` class and replaced with `EventLogger` wherever used
- Removed `get_active_exchange_markets` function from the `OrderBookDataSource` class and wherever used. Also refactored some parts of the code for Liquid exchange that used this function
- Made a change in the quantization logic to use `math.floor` to round instead of the native `round` Python function to fix quantization to the smallest value
