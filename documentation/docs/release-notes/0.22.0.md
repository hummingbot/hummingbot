# Release Notes - Version 0.22.0

🚀 Welcome to `hummingbot` version 0.22.0! In this release, we added an external pricing source feature, addressed a number of bugs, and continuously working on the Liquidity Mining infrastructure.


## 📊 External Pricing Source

By default, pure market making strategy uses the order book’s mid price to calculate limit order prices. We added a feature that allows you to use another mid price from external sources such as another exchange, data feed, or an external API.

You may read through [External Pricing Source Configuration](https://docs.hummingbot.io/strategies/advanced-mm/price-source/) in the user manual for more information.


## 🔗 Radar Relay upgrade to 0x v3

The Radar Relay connector is broken right now because they recently moved their API to a new version. You may encounter errors or bugs when using the connector in this version. We will send an announcement in future release notes once Hummingbot’s connector is updated.

Here we list recent major changes to Hummingbot docs:

* Added [Liquidity Mining FAQ](https://docs.hummingbot.io/faq/liquidity-mining/) and list of upcoming campaigns
