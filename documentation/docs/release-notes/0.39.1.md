# Release Notes - Version 0.39.1


This release is a hotfix to version [0.39.0](/release-notes/0.39.0).

KuCoin has changed its API endpoint today, which requires users to sign the requests. This results in 404 error issues when restarting the strategy (stop and start) while using the connector.

This version contains a fix [#3506](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/pull/3506) to an issue when fetching the order book snapshot as described in [#3505](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/issues/3505).
