# Release Notes - Version 0.31.0

## 🔗 New connector: Crypto.com

We are thrilled to announce that we partnered with leading crypto exchange [Crypto.com](https://crypto.com/exchange) to integrate Hummingbot’s trading capabilities and bring liquidity mining to the exchange!

Crypto.com was founded in 2016 on a simple belief: it’s a basic human right for everyone to control their money, data and identity. Crypto.com serves over 3 million customers today, providing them with a powerful alternative to traditional financial services through the Crypto.com App, the Crypto.com Card and the Crypto.com Exchange.

More information in our documentation [here](/connectors/crypto-com) on how to use the connector.


## 🔗 Bittrex Connector v3 Update

As Bittrex announced in a recent [tweet](https://twitter.com/BittrexExchange/status/1273408336214491136), their API v3 is now live. According to Bittrex [v1-1 documentation](https://bittrex.github.io/api/v1-1) the old API v1.1 will be deprecated by September 30, 2020.

In line with this change, we updated our Bittrex connector to make it compatible with v3 API along with unit test cases.


## 📊 Improved External Pricing Source for Pure Market Making

In the previous versions, Hummingbot can use the order book's mid price of your current market or another supported market when using the external pricing source. Starting this release, users can also use the market's last trade price, best bid price or best ask price as the price reference point when creating orders.

More information in our documentation in [External Pricing Source Configuration](/strategies/advanced-mm/price-source) page.

## 💻 Developers Updates

### Connector Change Summary

In the ongoing effort to make the Hummingbot code base more developer friendly, we refactored several parts of the exchange connector code to make it easier to add additional exchanges in the future:

* Added a new `ExchangeBase` class to replace `MarketBase` [#2243](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/issues/2243), [#2250](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/pull/2250)
* Removed `OrderBookTrackerDataSourceType` and `UserStreamTrackerDataSourceType` from connector [#2244](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/issues/2244), [#2270](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/pull/2270)
* Moved exchange connectors to a new location: [hummingbot/connector/exchange](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/tree/development/hummingbot/connector/exchange)</br>[#2244](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/issues/2244), [#2270](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/pull/2270)
* Added `_real_time_balance_update` to `ExchangeBase`, set this to `True` if your connector doesn't provide account balance 
update via web socket API, you will also need to set `_in_flight_orders_snapshot` and `_in_flight_orders_snapshot_timestamp` 
during balance update [#2017](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/issues/2017), [#2224](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/pull/2224)
* Formalize trading pair format, except within the connector module, all trading pairs are in BASE-QUOTE format [#2091](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/issues/2091), [#2097](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/pull/2097)
* Remove market argument on `InFlightOrderBase` (it was never used for anything)
