# Release Notes - Version 0.19.0

🚀 Welcome to `hummingbot` version 0.19.0! In this release, we focused on working and testing upcoming connectors along with addressing identified and reported bugs.


## 📊 Important update on UI
* We have created a consistent interface for all trading pairs on different exchanges, which means when you configure your bot,
  You can enter "BASE-QUOTE" (e.g. ETH-USDT) for your trading pair input on any exchange. 
  
  However, this means you have to edit all of your old config files and replace any trading_pair / symbol inputs to the new
  format. 

## 🤓 Developer usability

* Tutorial for creating custom strategies now has its own dedicated section. It is currently a work-in-progress but you can check out the initial parts [here](/developers/tutorial).
* [Architecture](/developers/connectors/architecture) section that includes additional details for adding new connectors.
* Added detailed examples to [Building Connectors](/developers/connectors/tutorial) in using aioconsole for testing.


## 🐞 Other bug fixes and miscellaneous updates

Thanks to everyone who reported bugs! **Note that we pay bug bounties to anyone who reports a bug that we end up fixing.**
