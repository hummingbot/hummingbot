## New Protocol Connector : Uniswap v3

With the new version's Concentrated Liquidity, traders can control over what price ranges their capital is allocated to. In addition, Uniswap v3 allows liquidity providers to be compensated accordingly for taking on varying degrees of risk.

## New UniswapV3 Iteration 1 strategy

### `uniswap_v3_lp`

Create new liquidity positions and automate the process of readjusting these positions once the market price moves outside of the starting price range.

## Additional Features : Rate Oracle now in AMM - Arbitrage!

Get rates required to calculate arbitrage proposals profitability.

## New Strategy Features with Avellaneda Market-Making

### `order_levels`

- A new strategy command that can be initiated when `parameters_based_on_spread = true`.
- The order size of the level will be equal to `order_amount` the spread between the orders will be calculated based on the `max_spread`, and the new orders related to order levels will be created between the first order and `max_spread`, distributed exponentially.
- When `parameters_based_on_spread` = false, the behaviour of [`order_levels`](/strategies/avellaneda-market-making/#order-levels) will be similar to `pure_market_making`

### `order_override`

If you prefer manual control of orders rather than bot calculated `order_amount` and `order_level_parameter`, manually set order value of buy/sell, order spread, and order amount with [`order_override`](/strategies/avellaneda-market-making/#order_override).

**You can only set the `order_override` in the strategy config file you created.**
