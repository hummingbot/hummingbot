# Release Notes - Version 0.17.0

🚀 Welcome to `hummingbot` version 0.17.0! This release includes the launch of a Bittrex connector, developer documentation for custom strategies, and improvements to the portfolio performance calculation. We also continued to address reported and identified bugs.


## 🔗 New Bittrex connector

Hummingbot now supports [Bittrex Global](https://global.bittrex.com/)! Bittrex is a global, centralized cryptocurrency exchange based in Seattle, USA. It is an intuitive and easy to navigate exchange platform often finding its way into the top 3 US exchanges in terms of trading volume.

Read more about how to use Bittrex connector with Hummingbot in the [User Manual](https://docs.hummingbot.io/connectors/bittrex/).


## 📊 New performance analysis calculation

We redesigned how Hummingbot analyzes performance so that events unrelated to Hummingbot’s actions (e.g. deposits, withdrawals, manual trades) do not impact the performance calculation; percentage profit is now based solely on assets spent and acquired from trading. Refer to our document in [Performance Analysis](https://docs.hummingbot.io/operation/commands/history/) for more information.


## 📝 More developer documentation

We published a developer tutorial on building custom strategies and documentation for the **Perform Trade** strategy.

* [Perform Trade Strategy](https://docs.hummingbot.io/developers/tutorial/perform-trade/)


## 📚Log file management / data storage

* A separate log file will now be generated daily. When a new log file is created, if there are more than 7 files, the oldest ones will be deleted in order to limit disk storage usage.
* AWS free tier provides 7.7GB of disk space. Ubuntu files take about 1.1 GB, Docker takes about 0.4 GB, and hummingbot image takes about 2.5 GB. This leaves about 3.7 GB for the logs and data files, which should be enough, especially now that we have set up log rotation. Refer to [Amazon Web Services](https://docs.hummingbot.io/installation/cloud/#amazon-web-services) section under Setup a Cloud Server in User Manual.
