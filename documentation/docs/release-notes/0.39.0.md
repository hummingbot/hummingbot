## New Exchange Connector: FTX Spot

[FTX](https://ftx.com) is a cryptocurrency derivatives exchange whose team comes from Wall Street quant firms and tech companies. It supports quarterly and perpetual futures for all major cryptocurrencies, leveraged tokens, and OTC.

Starting this release, Hummingbot only supports spot trading but will be expanded to include perpetuals in a future release.

## New Avellaneda Market Making Parameter: Volatility Sensibility

In the previous version, Avellaneda market-making strategy's `vol_to_spread_multiplier` is used to expand spreads when it detects the volatility and, at the same time, acts as a threshold for parameter recalculation when the volatility regime changes.

This release introduces a new parameter, `volatility_sensibility` to recalculate every time the current volatility goes beyond its % value from the original volatility when the parameters were initially calculated. While `vol_to_spread_multiplier` only expands the minimum and maximum spreads if this value multiplied by volatility is greater than the minimum spread.

## Bug Fixes

- [#3328](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/issues/3328) Fixed inconsistent balance updates in AscendEx, resulting to orders not created on specific cycles
- [#3235](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/pull/3235) Fixed Avellaneda eta calculation, now at the maximum distance from inventory_target and opposing order decays 90% from the original amount
- [#3218](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/pull/3218) Fixed Avellaneda spread update during volatility
- [#3195](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/pull/3195) Changed condition to check for "volatility is not NaN" when using Avellaneda market making, since when volatility=0 although being valid number "bool(volatility) =False" and the status message was not showing
- [#3183](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/issues/3183) Fixed instances when, while running the avellaneda_mm strategy, you enter the `status` command and the output doesn't show the strategy parameters (risk factor, order_book_depth_factor, volatility, and closing time)
- [#3144](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/pull/3144) `get_active_markets` in the Kucoin connector was changed to `fetch_active_markets` because the former had a check that prevented the reading of newly added markets
- [#2790](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/issues/2790) Parsing errors on Binance US when selecting a trading pair with 4-letter quote asset
