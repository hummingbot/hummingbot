# Eagle Club introduction

The Eagle Club is the VIP program we provide for top liquidity miners. The goal of the Club is to enhance the user experience of top performing miners and to provide dedicated support to help them trade more confidently and perform better.

The Eagle Club is invite-only. It’s not only a VIP program that Team Hummingbot will devote energy and time to, but also a close-knit community for experienced crypto traders to share their thoughts and obtain personalized support.

Anyone who gets in will stay in the Club permanently.
