## 🔑 Connection

Since this exchange is an Ethereum-based decentralized exchange (DEX), first run `connect ethereum` in order to connect your Ethereum wallet. See [Ethereum](/protocols/ethereum) for more information. Then, go to dYdX and create API keys for the same Ethereum wallet.

Next, run `connect dydx_perpetual` in Hummingbot in order to add your API keys. 

You will need the following to connect Hummingbot to `dydx_perpetual`:

   - API key
   - API secret key
   - Passphrase
   - Account number: set this value to `0`
   - Stark private key

API credentials and a stark private key can be obtained programmatically using their documentation:

- [Recover Default API Credentials](https://docs.dydx.exchange/?python#recover-default-api-credentials)
- [Derive StarkKey](https://docs.dydx.exchange/?python#derive-starkkey)

Alternatively, you can follow these steps to get the required credentials:

1. From the dydx Perpetuals exchange, right-click anywhere on your web browser, and select **Inspect** to open Developer Tools
2. Go to Application > Local Storage > https://trade.dydx.exchange
3. Select **STARK_KEY_PAIRS** and click the drop-down next to your wallet address to get the stark private key
4. Select **API_KEY_PAIRS** and click the drop-down next to your wallet address to get the API key, secret key, and passphrase

## 🪙 Fees

Hummingbot assumes 0.05% maker fees and 0.20% taker fees ([source](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/blob/master/hummingbot/connector/exchange/dydx/dydx_utils.py#L11)).
