![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*ZlrtjaSC6xqJGWfeh_kDmg.png)
[Harmony](https://harmony.one/) is a new base layer blockchain for decentralized economies. Partnering with Harmony, we have launched **$ONE Makers**, a liquidity bounty program rewarding community members for providing liquidity.

Users who use Hummingbot to build and run market making bots for $ONE can earn rewards based on their filled limit order volume.

## Timeline

$ONE Makers will run from July 1, 2019 to October 31, 2019, split into 4 monthly competition periods:

* July 1st to July 31st
* August 1st to August 31st
* September 1st to September 30th
* October 1st to October 31st

Each period begins at 12am UTC on the 1st of the month and ends at 12am UTC time on the 1st of the following month.

## Rewards¹

Users can earn the following achievements during each competition period. Achievements in each period stack, allowing users to earn multiple tiers.

The leaderboard and the rewards schedule reset at the end of every period.

## Updates and Announcements

We send out updates and announcements through our [Discord channel](https://discord.hummingbot.io) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/hummingbot_io).

You can also read through the articles in our [blog](https://hummingbot.io/blog/tag/liquidity-bounties#tags) where you can find useful information about liquidity bounties such as statistics, Q&A, interviews from our top bounty hunters, previous month recap, and more.

## Performance

Check your performance in our real-time [leaderboard](https://hummingbot.io/liquidity-bounties/harmony#performance) using your registered wallet address.

## Evaluation

Once the program officially kicks off, the rewards will be paid out **monthly** based on the **actual trading activity** of the participants. The Hummingbot client automatically collects order and trade data in order to verify filled limit order volume and to prevent market manipulative practices like wash trading. We may request read-only exchange API keys from users for verification purposes prior to paying out rewards.

Payouts occur approximately one week after the end of each period. All rewards will be subject to the sole discretion of the token issuer and/or the Hummingbot team.
