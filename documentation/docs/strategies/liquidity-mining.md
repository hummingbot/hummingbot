# `liquidity_mining`

## 📁 [Strategy folder](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/tree/master/hummingbot/strategy/liquidity_mining)

## 📝 Summary

This strategy allows market making across multiple pairs on an exchange on a single Hummingbot instance. This is achieved by enabling users to configure the markets they would like to participate in and other market-making configurations. Volatility-Spread adjustment is another key feature of this strategy, where the spreads are dynamically adjusted based on the volatility of the markets.

## 🏦 Exchanges supported

[`spot` exchanges](/exchanges/#spot)

## 👷 Maintenance

* Release added: [0.37.0](/release-notes/0.37.0/) by CoinAlpha
