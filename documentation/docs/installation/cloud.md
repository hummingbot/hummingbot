# Setup a Cloud Server

Using Hummingbot as a long running service can be achieved with the help of cloud platforms such as Google Cloud Platform, Amazon Web Services, and Microsoft Azure. You may read our blog about running [Hummingbot on different cloud providers](https://www.hummingbot.io/blog/2019-06-cloud-providers/).

Below, we show you how to set up a new Virtual Machine Instance on each major cloud platform.

!!! tip "Tip: Access Cloud Instances on your Phone"
    Use Hummingbot's [Telegram Integration](/utilities/telegram) to connect to your cloud instance without a computer. Note that this has limited functionality and remains a work in progress.

## Google Cloud Platform

   * Navigate to the Google Cloud Platform console
   * Create an instance of Compute Instance
   * Select “New VM Instance”, then pick `Ubuntu 18.04 LTS`

## Amazon Web Services

   * Navigate to the AWS Management Console
   * Click on "Launch a Virtual Machine"

   * Select `Ubuntu Server 18.04 LTS (HVM)`

   * Choose an Instance Type: 
   
     The Free tier `t2.micro` option should be enough for beginner user running a single bot.
    
     ![Select Instance Type](/assets/img/aws3.png)
     AWS's `t2.micro` instance allocates 7.7 GB of storage by default. After docker and hummingbot installation,
     3.5 GB remains for logs and data files generated by the client. 
     
     If you are running multiple bots in the same instance, you may want to consider choose an Instance Type that 
     offers more storage.

     After you have chosen an Instance Type, click on "Review and Launch", and then "Launch"
     
   * Select “create a new key pair”, name the key pair (e.g. hummingbot), download key pair, and then click on “Launch Instances”.
