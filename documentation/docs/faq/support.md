    Beware of scammers imitating core team and community members. We will NEVER solicit funds from our users, and we will NEVER ask anyone for any sensitive information, e.g., passwords, private keys, etc.

## Ways to get support

### Discord

Our official [Discord server](https://discord.hummingbot.io) is the primary gathering spot for announcements, user support, trading strategies, connectors, and other discussion about Hummingbot.

When you sign up for our Discord, please check that the link you are accessing is: `https://discord.hummingbot.io`.

**We will never initiate direct messages to our users.** If a random user imitating the core team or any of the community members sends you a DM don't hesitate to report it in our official Discord channel.

!!! note
    Currently, our Discord server and WeChat (Chinese) are the only officially-supported online Hummingbot community. We do not maintain any other communities on Telegram, Slack, or other applications. Please beware that any such communities (except for the official Hummingbot Discord and WeChat) may be scams.
