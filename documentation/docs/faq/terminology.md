## Market making terminology
Market making, along with algorithmic trading generally, uses industry-specific terminology. We define some of the most commonly used terms below.

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **base asset** | The asset in a trading pair whose quantity is fixed as a single unit in a price quote. For example, in a price quotation of ETH/DAI 100, ETH is the **base asset** and 100 is the amount of DAI exchangeable for each unit of ETH.<br/><br/>In Hummingbot, the first token in a trading pair is always the base asset. See **quote asset** for more info.
| **centralized exchange (“CEX”)** | An exchange which is operated by a central authority.  In addition to order matching and broadcasting, the centralized exchange keeps custody of users’ assets.
| **decentralized exchange (“DEX”)** | An exchange which operates in a decentralized way, using smart contracts to facilitate the transacting in and settling of assets. Generally, one distinguishing feature of a decentralized exchange is that participants keep custody of their own assets in their own wallets; the DEX facilitates the direct wallet-to-wallet settlement between counterparties in a transaction.
| **maker** | A party that places _maker orders_, and in doing so, provides liquidity to the market.
| **maker order** | A “limit order”; which is an order to buy or sell an asset at a specified price and quantity.  Execution of this order is not guaranteed; the order is only filled if there is a taker that accepts the price and quantity and transacts.
| **order book** | A list of currently available (maker) orders on an exchange, showing all of the current buyer and seller interest in an asset.
| **quote asset** | The asset in a asset pair whose quantity varies and whose quantity is denoted by the numerical figure of the price quote. For example, in a price quotation of ETH/DAI 100, DAI is the quote currency and 100 units of DAI are referenced in this exchange.<br/><br/>In Hummingbot, the second token in a trading pair is always the quote asset. See **base asset** for more info.
| **taker** | A party that places _taker orders_, which execute immediately and fill a maker order.
| **taker order** | A “market order”; an order to buy or sell a specified quantity of an asset which is filled immediately at the best available price(s) available on the exchange.
| **mid price** | The average of best bid and best ask price in the orderbook.
| **hedging price** | In cross exchange strategy, is the net cost of the other side of your limit order i.e., the cost of you making a taker order.<br/><br/>*For example on your taker market, if you can buy 25 tokens for say a net price of $100 (other market makers have limit sell orders at a net price of 100 for all 25, e.g. 7.5 @ $99, 10 @ $100, 7.5 @ $101), then on your maker side, you would place a limit sell order for 25 @ $101 (assume 1% min profitability). If someone fills your sell order (you sell at $101), you immediately try to hedge by buying on the taker side at $100.*
