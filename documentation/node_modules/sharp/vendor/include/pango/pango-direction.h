/**
 * PangoDirection:
 * @PANGO_DIRECTION_LTR: A strong left-to-right direction
 * @PANGO_DIRECTION_RTL: A strong right-to-left direction
 * @PANGO_DIRECTION_TTB_LTR: Deprecated value; treated the
 *   same as %PANGO_DIRECTION_RTL.
 * @PANGO_DIRECTION_TTB_RTL: Deprecated value; treated the
 *   same as %PANGO_DIRECTION_LTR
 * @PANGO_DIRECTION_WEAK_LTR: A weak left-to-right direction
 * @PANGO_DIRECTION_WEAK_RTL: A weak right-to-left direction
 * @PANGO_DIRECTION_NEUTRAL: No direction specified
 *
 * The #PangoDirection type represents a direction in the
 * Unicode bidirectional algorithm; not every value in this
 * enumeration makes sense for every usage of #PangoDirection;
 * for example, the return value of pango_unichar_direction()
 * and pango_find_base_dir() cannot be %PANGO_DIRECTION_WEAK_LTR
 * or %PANGO_DIRECTION_WEAK_RTL, since every character is either
 * neutral or has a strong direction; on the other hand
 * %PANGO_DIRECTION_NEUTRAL doesn't make sense to pass
 * to pango_itemize_with_base_dir().
 *
 * The %PANGO_DIRECTION_TTB_LTR, %PANGO_DIRECTION_TTB_RTL
 * values come from an earlier interpretation of this
 * enumeration as the writing direction of a block of
 * text and are no longer used; See #PangoGravity for how
 * vertical text is handled in Pango.
 *
 * If you are interested in text direction, you should
 * really use fribidi directly. PangoDirection is only
 * retained because it is used in some public apis.
