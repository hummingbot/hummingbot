🚀 Welcome to `hummingbot` version 0.24.0! In this release, we continuously worked on the backend to improve Liquidity Mining in preparation for the upcoming launch, modified order amount to improve first-time user experience, and addressed a couple of bugs in the Binance connector.

## 🌊⛏ Liquidity mining going live on March 3rd

We will be launching Liquidity Mining officially on Tuesday, March 3rd, 2020 12:00 AM UTC! We welcome anyone interested to earn token rewards on the [Hummingbot Miners App](https://miners.hummingbot.io).

Please refer to the following links and resources for more information:

- [Hummingbot Miners App](https://miners.hummingbot.io)
- [Participation Guide](https://docs.hummingbot.io/miner/liquidity-mining/overview/)
- [Hummingbot Help Center](https://hummingbot.zendesk.com/hc/en-us)
- [Liquidity Mining Policy](https://hummingbot.io/liquidity-mining-policy/)

## 📊 Minimum order amount

The `order_amount` parameter in pure market-making and cross-exchange strategy now displays during prompt a default minimum value. This allows users to prevent entering a value below the exchange’s minimum order size resulting in no orders being created. Advanced users who want more flexibility can change or zero out the minimums in the global config file.

## 📓 Documentation updates

Here we list other recent significant changes to Hummingbot docs:

- Reworked Liquidity Mining section\* Improved quickstart guide for Windows, macOS, and Linux
- Added information in the FAQ on how to submit a feature/feedback request
  Added instructions on locating the data file in Hummingbot installed via binary, checking the status of multiple bots simultaneously, adding paper trade balance from inside the client, and refreshing Hummingbot window pane.
