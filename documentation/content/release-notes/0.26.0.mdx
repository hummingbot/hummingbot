🚀 Welcome to `hummingbot` version 0.26.0! This release contains many changes in the Hummingbot client aimed at improving the user experience for new and existing users alike.

<Callout

  body="`Old config files won't work` This release contains many changes to the import process, so previous strategy configuration files will not be compatible with this version."

## 🔐 New password screen

Now, you are asked to enter your password when you start the Hummingbot client.

## ⌨️ Revamped commands

We have extensively revamped the commands in Hummingbot. New commands include:

- `connect`: displays a list of available exchanges and helps you connect to them
- `balance`: see your asset balances across all exchanges
- `create`: create a bot
- `import`: import an existing bot configuration

See the [Command Reference](/operation/overview/#hummingbot-commands) for all commands.

## 🍱 Standardized parameter names and spread/percent inputs

We have changed parameter names in the Pure Market Making strategy to make them clearer. For example, the frequency used to cancel and refresh orders is now `order_refresh_time` (old name: `cancel_order_wait_time`). Here are all the new [Basic](/strategies/pure-market-making/#basic-parameters) and [Advanced](/strategies/adv-market-making/#advanced-pure-market-making-parameters) parameters.

In addition, we have standardized all **spread** and **percent** inputs, so that users enter percentage values. For example, to set a 1% `bid_spread`, enter `1` instead of `0.01`. To set a 5% `kill_switch_pct`, enter `5` instead of `0.05`.

Any parameter names that end with `-pct` or `-spread` use this format.

## 💸 Change spreads on the fly

An often-requested feature is the ability to adjust the bot without stopping it. So we have started to make more parameters adjustable on the fly, starting with spreads.

Now you can use the revamped [config](/operation/overview/#hummingbot-commands) command to adjust spreads without stopping the bot. We plan to extend this functionality to other parameters such as order amount in the future.

## 🔗 New Kraken connector

Hummingbot now supports [Kraken](https://www.kraken.com/) exchange! Kraken is a centralized exchange where users can trade several cryptocurrencies and various fiat currencies such as USD, CAD, EUR, GBP, CHF, and JPY.

Read more about how to use Kraken connector [here](/spot-connectors/kraken/).

## 📱 Improved Telegram integration

The Telegram integration now has a smaller keyboard that doesn't block the main view. In addition, displayed messages are now in HTML instead of Markdown to improve readability.
