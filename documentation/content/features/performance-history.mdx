## How It Works

Run the `history` command in Hummingbot to display the current duration of total past trades, assets inventory, and value, market trading pair performance.

## Sample Output

## Average Price

Avg Price = Total trade volume of quote/Total trade volume of base asset.

In the [sample output](#sample-output), the total avg price is 6.91/47423 = 0.0001457

This value means the average price of total MFT/BNB trades is 0.0001457

## Hold Portfolio Value

The asset value from the start to the end with no trades.

Hold portfolio value = (base start asset\*current market price)+ quote start asset

From the above example, for the Hold portfolio value is (155248\*0.0000809)+23.33=35.89

## Current Portfolio Value

Current portfolio value = (base current asset\*current market price)+ quote current asset

From the above example, the Current portfolio value is (202671\*0.0000809)+16.419=32.815

## Trade P&L

Trade P&L = Current portfolio value - Hold Portfolio value

From the above example, for the Trade P&L value is 32.815-35.89=-3.075

## Total P&L

Total P&L = Trade P&L + Fees paid

From the above example, for the Total P&L is -3.075 + -0.428 = -3.504

## Return Percentage

Return% = Total P&L/Hold portfolio value

From the above example, for the Return% is -3.075/-35.89 = -9.76%

The **Return %** (bottom navbar) matches the calculated return on **History** after the last trade. See the following screenshot:

If the trading pair price moves, the **History** changes, but **Return %** retains the calculated return based on the last price, see the following screenshot:
